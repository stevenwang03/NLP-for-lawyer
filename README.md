A judgement is the final decision of a Court about a litigation between a plaintiff and a
defendant. This section is usually composed by many different sentences. Few of these
sentences are irrelevant because they simply are support of the judge’s ruling (eg. “ Par ces
motifs ”, “ Statuant par arrêt contradictoire mis à disposition au greffe ”). The other kind of
sentences bear the Court pronouncements on the particular claims brought forth by the parties
(eg. “ Condamne la societe a verser .. ”), or on the judgement of previous court rulings (eg.
" Confirme le jugement entrepris en ce qu’il a .. ”).
The purpose of this exercise is to define a similarity measure (whose value is between 0 and
1, being 1 the highest similarity score) and to compute the similarity distances between a
given set of phrases representing topics, and sentences that make the judgement.
